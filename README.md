  ### Features
* FPS-independent timing.
* Efficient tile-based drawing.
* Culling of out-of-view objects.
* Code-based animations.
* Load of stages from bitmap files (each pixel corresponds to a tile, arbitrary dimensions).

**Note:** if you want to create your own stages, do not modify the top line of pixels; it is used as palette.

## Getting Started

* Runs on any system/OS that supports Java (but currently requires keyboard input).
* No installation procedure required.
* [JRE](https://www.java.com/download/) required.

### Running:

Required files for running / distribution:
* game.jar
* img/\*.\*
* stage.bmp, stage2.bmp, stage3.bmp
* 8bitOperatorPlus-Bold.ttf

## TODO

* Sounds
* Main Menu
* Customizable controls / touchscreen support
* More stages/enemies/items
